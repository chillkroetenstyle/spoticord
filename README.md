# spoticord

*spoticord* is a discord bot that allows you to play your music directly from spotify to discord. You need to host your own instance of this bot because it ties directly to your Spotify account. You need an Spotify Premium account for this to work.

## Installation

__TBD__
but here's a rough outline:
- node
- librespot
- download bot
- create run-script with Spotify credentials for librespot
- create config-file with Discord's and Spotify's API tokens

## Disclaimer

This bot uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespotlibrespot) to play music. And as they say:  
"Using this code to connect to Spotify's API is probably forbidden by them. Use at your own risk." Be aware!
